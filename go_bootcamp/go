var (
	name     string = "Prince Oberyn"
	age      int    =  32
	location string = "Dorne"
)

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted, the variable will take the type of the initializer (inferred typing).

var (
	name     = "Prince Oberyn"
	age      =  32
	location = "Dorne"
)


func main() {
	action := func() { //action is a variable that contains a function
		//doing something
	}
	action()
}


While you can print the value of a variable or constant using the built-in print and println functions, the more idiomatic and flexible way is to use the fmt package
