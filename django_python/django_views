Django views are Python functions that takes http requests and returns http response, like HTML documents.

A web page that uses Django is full of views with different tasks and missions.

Views are usually put in a file called views.py located on your app's folder.
 
There is a views.py in your members folder that looks like this:

my_tennis_club/members/views.py:

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
