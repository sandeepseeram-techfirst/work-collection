Create App
I will name my app members.

Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, in my case the my_tennis_club folder, and run the command below.

If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press [CTRL] [BREAK], or [CTRL] [C] to stop the server and you should be back in the virtual environment.

# py manage.py startapp members
