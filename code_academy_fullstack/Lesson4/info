JavaScript uses functions, which are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.


1. Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over.
2. Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviors, like the user hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window.


Events and functions combine to give JavaScript the ability to create interactive experiences. When an event is fired, a function is executed. This pattern is used again and again in web development to create interactive websites.
