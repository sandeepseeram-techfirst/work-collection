JavaScript uses functions, which are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.


1. Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over.
2. Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviors, like the user hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window.
