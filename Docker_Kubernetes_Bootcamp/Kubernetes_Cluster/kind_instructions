Points: The Kubernetes tools are backward- and forward-compatible with different versions of the 
Kubernetes API as long as you stay within two minor versions for both the tools and the cluster. 

Kubernetes follows the semantic versioning specification, where the minor version is the middle number (e.g., the 18 in 1.18.2)
